Our movie is about a cute dog and a robot confronting two snakes. In the beginning, the dog and and the robot are hanging out; they are chasing each other and running around. While they are happily playing together, two scary snakes show up and the dog and the robot find them and freeze for a moment. Then they start to run away from snakes. After a long chase, the dog and the robot disappears behind the corner. The two snakes continue to chase them, thinking they are still running away from them. However, when the dog and the robot reappear with nets on their hands, the snakes realize they are in trouble, so THEY end up running away. The special effects we used were seeingRed, fade, and screenShake. When the dog and the robot find the snakes, we used seeingRed to emphasize the urgency. We used screenShake right after seeingRed to show the tension going on between the snakes and the robot and the dog. Lastly, we used fade in the end of the movie when the snakes are running away from the dog and the robot. We combined filming, editing, and performance code because we wanted to add special effects right after we filmed and then combined them into a gif file so it takes less steps into making it a movie.
